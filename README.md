# Spotify-Music-Moods
This project uses K-means clustering to identify music moods based on the song's musical features. The first cluster analysis only includes the musical features, and the second cluster takes the sentiment score from the song lyrics to identify the lyrical nature of the clusters. Three clusters were found and each corresponded to a different mood. Data was gathered using the Spotify and Lyrics Genius API.
