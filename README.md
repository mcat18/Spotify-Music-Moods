# Spotify-Music-Moods
This project uses K-means clusting to identify music moods based on the musical features of the clusters. The first cluster analysis only includes the musical features and the second cluster takes the sentiment score from the song lyrics to identify the lyrical nature of the clusters. Data was gathered using Spotify's API and Lyrics Genius API.
